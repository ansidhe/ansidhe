Hi, I’m @ansidhe - that's shorter (and admittedly incorrect as far as orthography goes ;>) for Aen Seidhe - an Irish gealic term for an elf. I've been using this nickname since the 90s when my head was full of Witcher stories ;)...

I’m interested in all-things-data, backend and functional-style programming.
I’m currently dusting-off my SQL and C that I had been using 20 years ago ;), with an aim to learn Python, R and Golang - and transition into becoming a data engineeer. 

That's for starters ;) and let's see where that leads me.
 
I'll be building my personal show-off portfolio here, one step at a time...
